## Before start is necessary have previously installed:
- [Git][Git]
- [Python 2.7.9](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pip](https://packaging.python.org/installing/)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)
- [Elasticsearch][Elasticsearch]
### Optional:
- [Docker][Docker]

### Google App Engine Account
- Create new [google account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new OAUTH account.
- Use this account in JS file:
```
$ app/client/app/app.js
```
- Find by **clientId** and put that key on there.

### Clone this repository:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/marcuslacerda/stack-gallery.git
```

Then, you must use [Python 2.7.9 ][Python] to install the following all libraries required:

```console
$ cd stack-gallery/app
$ pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib
```
If you don't have python local environments, you could use docker environment describe below.

You must define these environments on your variable.
```console
$ export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=set-google-client-id-here_or_export-env-vavariable>
$ export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=set-google-client-secret-here_or_export-env-vavariable>
$ export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=url-to-elasticsearch-stack
```

At last, you can start the local web server using this command and access url http://localhost:5000

```console
$ cd app
$ python run_local.py
```

If you have gcloud environment, you can use the command bellow and access url  http://localhost:8080:
```console
$ dev_appserver.py .
```

## Running (by docker)
You must install [Docker][] on your environment. After you can build the image using the following command.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/marcuslacerda/stack-gallery.git
$ docker build -t stack-app:latest .
```

Run the Docker container using the command shown below.

```console
$ docker run -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200 -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<put-your-client-secret> -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<put-your-client-id> -p 5000:5000 stack-app
```

If you need a full local enviroment, you must start [Elasticsearch] and change elasticsearch host at ELASTICSEARCH_URL variable.

You must configure these GOOGLE values from [Google APIs console]

```console
$ docker run -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch
```

To execute tests, install all dependencies from requirements_test.txt into lib_tests path:
```
pip install -r requirements_test.txt -t lib_tests
```

To run the tests
```console
$ nosetests -v tests
```
#### Coverage:

To measure tests coverage in Python code. This recipe runs nosetests suite and presents coverage at the end:
```
nosetests -v --with-cover --cover-html --cover-package=. tests/
```
A detailed report from coverage can be found at cover folder in project's path.


## Continuous Delivery

### Skipping a build
If you donâ€™t want to run a build for a particular commit any reason add [ci skip] or [skip ci] to the git commit message.
Commits that have [ci skip] or [skip ci] anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.


## Production
```
$ gcloud app deploy -v production
```

# Jobs
